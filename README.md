ShortestPathDijkstra
====================
To draw a network manually and generate the highlighted 
path which will show the shortest distance from one node
(referred to as the source here) to another node(referred 
to as the destination).

In the GUI,we individually plot the nodes by clicking onto
the screen which are labelled as A,B,C and so on.After creating
the nodes, we draw edges in between them by dragging from one
edge to another edge. Automatically,the weights will get assigned 
to the edges based on the distance formula.In the boxes created,
we enter the source and the destination node for which we 
are calculating the shortest distance.By doing so,the path 
from the source to the destination gets highlighted and the 
distance calculated alongwith the adjacency matrix.
